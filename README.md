# Sorcerer King
This Mod is inspired by the Manga `I Am The Sorcerer King`. The items and the progression path aim to references.

## Getting started
In the World spawned a new Ore - `Mana Ore` - which yields Mana Gems when mined.
Using a `Mana Gem` consumes it, and awakens the Player as a Sorcerer!

To cast spells you need a catalyst - the `Mana Cube`!
Create a `Magic Chisel` by combining a stick and a `Mana Gem`.
Combine `Mana Gems` to create a Mana Block, place it on the ground, 
and right click with the `Magic Chisel` to carve it into a Mana Cube.

Now, select the `Mana Cube`, and right click while Sneaking to enter the Spell Configuration menu.
